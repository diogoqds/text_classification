# Text Classification using open source
This repo is used to search and develop a pipeline for
text classification that can be adapted to different 
problems.

## Python or Jupyter
To run the code as a python script, just go inside the folder text_classification on the same level as docs and run

````bash
python3 main.py
````

Or if you have running jupyter notebook server just open the main.ipynb

Ps: As the datasets can be too big, they're being ignored. So it's necessary to download and manually place inside the dataset->representations->NAME_OF_YOUR_DATASET folder
